One thing important is one thing you need to understand where gang really started from. The CIA started the gang campaign back in the 60s .
There goal was to get low income commodities to go to war with each other so you take each other out without responsible for the fallout impact. 
At this point they have won in this factor. Black, white , Asian, Spanish gang have lost over 100 million soldiers. 30.000 general and much more . Basically leader have did the work for napoleon. All though citizens won the Civil War because was united and had love for are land and country. 
Fast forward today it time to make a difference . I mean get organized like the Romain did. Rome never fell they went into the shadows and used the Bible and other factions that kept the Romain catholic church in complete control of humanity. 
So it's probably time to build.  Clean up are community. Get a grants from congress to fix the potholes. And upgrade your infrastructure so your property and community will be worth something. The property value should matter to all leader. Because if you want company to feel safe to move there's company into yours community's. If your wasn't aware for example LA if the tagging and community had a upgrade and gang violate was in control a house could sell over a million 1 . 5 easy. There's a lot to be done to get are community where it should be where you can run a legal business without looking over your shoulder . The next duty is get are children out of public school into a education equal to a Harvard curriculum style platform. We give are children a chance to make a decision on what type of life they want to live. 
This mission for all leader to walk with. Your not copy anyone if you use my work to change the narrative.
